# customer-self-care-portal
Basic Telecom Customer Self Care Portal developed using Python and Flask

The application ables customers to sign up and create profiles. Users can enter their income and calculate suitable packages for them 
and apply for them online. The original idea was for customers to be able to apply and submit their documents online. However, due to the fact 
that you have to code everything yourself in Flask, I left out the file upload task.
